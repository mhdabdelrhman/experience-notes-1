## Introduction

Below, I have provided the required evidence showcasing my experience in Progressive Web Apps (PWA), GPT API integration, other API integrations and AI projects, and payment system integration (Stripe).

## 1. Progressive WEB Apps (PWA)
### Project 1: [Codak-EPOS]
- **URL**: Unfortunately, the project URL is currently inaccessible at https://www.codak.co.uk/ 
- **Description**: Project Story: In Jan 2016, the project requirements were to develop a desktop POS application for a multi-branch company that would function online and continue operating offline if network errors occurred.
- **My Role**: Before the formal definition of Progressive Web Apps (PWA), I developed a desktop application with a local SQLite database (similar to IndexedDB) to store product information and prices, as well as record orders. I also created a worker service to act as a middleware between the frontend application and the server, facilitating the upload of orders to the server and the updating of local product details. While this was not technically a PWA, I implemented many of the core principles associated with PWA development.

### Project 2: [Code360-APAWS]
- **URL**: https://apaws-admin.code360.com.tr/
- **Description**: The Accident Prevention and Warning System is a comprehensive application I developed, consisting of three main services: a Web API server built with ASP.NET Core, a client application developed in Flutter, and an Admin Portal implemented as a Blazor PWA.
- **My Role**:  I was responsible for developing all components of the system. For the Admin Portal, I utilized Blazor PWA, as the project owner required the portal to function as an installed application on both Windows and tablets.

## 2. GPT API Integration
### Project 1: [Workiom-AI]
- **URL**: https://help.workiom.com/article/workiom-ai
- **Description**: Workiom is No-Code SaaS platform and Workiom AI is an intelligent agent designed to help clients create apps schemas for their data. This application leverages integrations with both the OpenAI API and Azure AI.
- **My Role**:  As a senior backend developer, I utilized the OpenAI Client SDK and Azure AI SDK for .NET to build a flexible integration interface, enabling the project owner to switch between the two AI services at runtime. I also crafted the prompts to guide GPT in understanding the requirements and delivering accurate results. The system includes two APIs: one generates the application schema as text (displayed on the left side in the following image), and the other generates a project schema in JSON format (right side in the image), which can be used by both frontend and backend applications to create the app's entities.

### Project 2: [LangChain-AI]
- **URL**: https://github.com/mhdabdelrhman/langchain-ai
- **Repository**: https://github.com/mhdabdelrhman/langchain-ai
- **Description**: Integration of LangChain and Ollama to enable users to interact with their PDF files through chat.
- **My Role**: I used LangChain (Python) and integrated it with the Ollama LLM and Qdrant Vector Database to develop a local application. This application allows users to upload PDF files and ask the LLM questions about the file's content.

## 3. Other API Integrations and AI Projects
### Project 1: [SmartHome-AI]
- **URL**: https://github.com/mhdabdelrhman/smart-home-ai
- **Repository**: https://github.com/mhdabdelrhman/smart-home-ai
- **Description**: A smart home proposal app that integrates GPT for controlling smart home actions through chat.
- **My Role**: I used the [Microsoft Semantic Kernel SDK](https://github.com/microsoft/semantic-kernel) to develop a proposal for this project, which integrates with OpenAI APIs to facilitate smart home interactions via chat.

### Project 2: [Workiom-Call API]
- **URL**: https://help.workiom.com/article/callapi
- **Description**: A generic API call integration for third-party services.
